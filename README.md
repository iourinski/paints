If you are using sbt as your build tool, you can install the SuperSafe Community Edition in two easy steps.

1. Add the Artima Maven Repository as a resolver in ~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt, like this:

resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"

otherwise the project will not assemble.
